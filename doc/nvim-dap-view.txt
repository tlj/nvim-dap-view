INSTALLATION                        *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-installation*


VIA LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    return {
        {
            "igorlfs/nvim-dap-view",
            opts = {},
        },
    }
<

For a better experience, consider adding `nvim-dap-view` **as a dependency**
for `nvim-dap` (instead of declaring it as a standalone plugin)

Why? ~

By default, when launching a session, `nvim-dap`’s terminal window takes half
the screen. As a saner default, `nvim-dap-view` hijacks the terminal window
(even if not invoked), making the split take only 12 (configurable) screen
lines.

>lua
    -- Your nvim-dap config
    return {
        {
            "mfussenegger/nvim-dap",
            dependencies = {
                { "igorlfs/dap-view", opts = {} },
                ...,
            },
            ...,
        },
    }

FEATURES                                *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-features*

The plugin provides 3 "views" that share the same window (so there’s clutter)

- Watches view
    - Shows a list of (user defined) expressions, that are evaluated by the debug adapter
    - Add, edit and delete expressions from the watch list
        - Including adding the variable under the cursor
- Exceptions view
    - Control when the debugger should stop, outside of breakpoints (e.g.,
        whenever an exception is thrown, or when an exception is caught).
    - Toggle filter with `<CR>`
- Breakpoints view
    - List all breakpoints
        - Uses syntax highlighting
        - Shows filename and number line
    - Jump to a breakpoint with `<CR>`


DOCUMENTATION                      *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-documentation*


CONFIGURATION ~

Default options ~

>lua
    return {
        winbar = {
            show = true,
            sections = { "watches", "exceptions", "breakpoints" },
            -- Must be one of the sections declared above
            default_section = "watches",
        },
        windows = {
            height = 12,
        },
    }
<


USAGE ~

Start a regular debugging session. When desired, you can use `:DapViewOpen` to
start the plugin. You can switch to a view (section) using the letter outlined
in the `'winbar'` (e.g., `B` for the breakpoints view).

Both the breakpoints view and the exceptions view have only 1 mapping: `<CR>`.
It jumps to a breakpoint and toggles an exception filter, respectively. The
watches view comes with 3 mappings:

- `i` to insert a new expression
- `e` to edit an expression
- `d` to delete an expression

Though, the preferred way of adding a new expression is using the
`:DapViewWatch` command. In normal mode, it adds the variable under the cursor
to the watch list.

When you finish your session, you can use `:DapViewClose` to close the
`nvim-dap-view` window.

In total, there are 4 commands:

- `DapViewOpen`
- `DapViewClose`
- `DapViewToggle`
- `DapViewWatch`

If you prefer using lua functions, I got you covered! The following provide the
same functionality as above:

>lua
    require("dap-view").open()
    require("dap-view").close()
    require("dap-view").toggle()
    require("dap-view").add_expr()
<

`nvim-dap-view` doesn’t define any keybindings (outside its own buffer, of
course). An example for the toggle functionality, using the lua API:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>v", function()
        require("dap-view").toggle()
    end, { desc = "Toggle nvim-dap-view" })
<


ROADMAP                                  *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-roadmap*

- Watches
    - Actions
        - Expanding variables
        - Yank expression’s value
- Threads and Stacks view

KNOWN ISSUES                        *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-known-issues*

- Breakpoints view doesn’t show breakpoint conditions
    - That’s a limitation with the current breakpoints API from `nvim-dap`. We
        could use an workaround, but a new API is
        planned <https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/issues/1388>


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-acknowledgements*

- Code to inject treesitter highlights into line is taken from
    `quicker.nvim` <https://github.com/stevearc/quicker.nvim>;
- Some snippets are directly extracted from `nvim-dap`
    - Currently,there’s no API to extract breakpoint information (see
        issue <https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/issues/1388>), so we
        resort to using nvim-dap internal mechanism, that tracks extmarks;
    - The magic to extract expressions from visual mode is also a courtesy of
        `nvim-dap`.
- lucaSartore <https://github.com/lucaSartore/nvim-dap-exception-breakpoints>
    for the inspiration for handling breakpoint exceptions;
- Kulala <https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala.nvim> for the creative usage
    of neovim’s `'winbar'` to handle multiple views.
